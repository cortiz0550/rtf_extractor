# rtf_extractor
I wrote a script that takes multiple RTF files and extracts vocabulary words from them for a task at my job.

## About the script
At work, I have a task where I take data generated from a vocabulary website based on a specific text, and input those words into a tracking spreadsheet along with their part of speech, and rating level. This tasks requires multiple downloads and lots of copy and pasting. To make it more efficient, I created this script that combines all the RTF files and then selects only the information I want, and then copies it to the clipboard so all I have to do is paste the words into the Google sheet. This has saved me a ton of time which I can spend on other tasks associated with this project.

## Using the script
This app is built specifically for me, so I need whichever RTF files I want to extract from all in the same folder. From there I just run the app.py program and then its output is put directly onto my clipboard  for me to paste into Google Sheets.
